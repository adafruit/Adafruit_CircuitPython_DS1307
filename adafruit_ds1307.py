`adafruit_ds1307` - DS1307 Real Time Clock module
=================================================

CircuitPython library to support DS1307 Real Time Clock (RTC).

This library supports the use of the DS1307-based RTC in CircuitPython.

Beware that most CircuitPython compatible hardware are 3.3v logic level! Make
sure that the input pin is 5v tolerant.

* Author(s): Philip R. Moyer and Radomir Dopieralski for Adafruit Industries

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit `DS1307 RTC breakout <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3296>`_ (Product ID: 3296)

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware (0.8.0+) for the ESP8622 and M0-based boards:
    https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
* Adafruit's Register library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register
* Adafruit's Bus Device library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice

**Notes:**

#.  Milliseconds are not supported by this RTC.
#.  Alarms and timers are not supported by this RTC.
#.  Datasheet: https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1307.pdf
